Feature: Multiple choice (WIRIS) answer-mode input options
    In order to trust both Multiple choice (WIRIS) answer modes
    As a student
    I want the single-answer (radio) and multiple-answer (checkbox) inputs to work in an attempt

    # A Multiple choice (WIRIS) question offers two answer modes, selected by the
    # "single" option: single answer renders radio buttons, multiple answer renders
    # checkboxes. The WIRIS renderer wraps the core multichoice single / multi
    # renderers, so the choices are clicked with the core
    # "qtype_multichoice > Answer" selector (it resolves the aria-labelledby answer
    # label used for both radios and checkboxes) and are graded by the answer
    # fractions. Both modes are therefore exercised end to end (selected and
    # graded). Questions are built from the qtype_multichoicewiris test helper
    # templates (singlechoice / multichoice), which use plain-text choices and
    # explicit fractions.
